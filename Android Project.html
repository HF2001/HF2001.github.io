<p1>This is the title screen, after a short time interval it will proceed to the main screen. Clicking the start button will then thrust you into the game. Clicking the both the correct and incorrect answers will give you a notifier, but only correct answers will advance the player. Once screen 9 has been reached, upon answer of its question...the second table arrangement will appear, thus giving the illusion of a screen change.
	The video is south of a minute however displays the Quiz Appâ€™s functionality.

<h2>Write Up</h2>
<br>
<p1>Having assembled a quiz app, such a design created a couple issues. To begin, what problems did arise needed critical thinking. For the procedure, there was not a lot of space to practically use it, and to be honest, more difficulty came from figuring out where to place the procedure than actually implementing one. In addition, the procedure was implemented for use to call notifiers, set a clock-timer, and play sounds. Another issue that was apparent, was the interval of the timer to call a new screen.
 Furthermore, whilst constructing the app, opportunities presented themselves for adding notifiers as well as sounds(concerning correct and incorrect answers). Both the sounds and the notifiers were required elements in the development process and were implemented into the window of time in which a question is answered. The independent contributions to the app were the implementations of the procedural call as well as the sound effects. In conclusion, the app is rather humorous, and without flaws...enjoy!
